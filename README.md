# Neural network for handwritten numbers classification

This is a Tensorflow architected Artificial Neural Network designed for classification of handwritten numbers using MNIST dataset.

The main goal of this project is to test the tensorflow neural network skills, and tensorboard understand.

Would you like to run? Unzip the MNIST zip file and set the constants for the datasets! 

IMPORTANT: Minor adjustments for Tensorflow 2.0!!!
